# Questionnaire maker

With QstMaker you can configure an interactive questionnaire. Each question with its possible responses will be displayed, and wait for the user selection. Can be either one or multiple choices. 

This project is built on the JavaScript library VueJs. So, you can download it and just run the qstmaker.html file.
